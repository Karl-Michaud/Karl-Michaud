## 👋 Hey, I'm Karl

I'm a third-year Computer Science and Mathematics double major at the University of Toronto (St. George). I like building stuff that solves real problems, whether it's a tool, an app, or something weird I came up with for fun.

I'm always tinkering. One week I'm writing a C framework, the next I'm building social apps to make campus life smoother. I like projects that feel useful and teach me something new.

**Fun fact**: I love cats and being outside 🐈‍⬛🌲.
